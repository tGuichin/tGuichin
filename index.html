<p>For software engineering class my team and I made an android application that is focused on reading a student syllabus and extracting the relevant information such as Professor name, number, e-mail and also the book ISBN number so you could look up the book price with a click of a button.  The application is made using Android Studio and the Tesseract OCR API.  While the API is not yet perfect, it manages to catch the information about 50% of the times depending on the quality of the image taken.  </p>

<p>This mini project was made for a friend who loves playing the card game Magic: The Gathering.  It simply takes two text files with magic decks and compares the differences between both.  If one deck has more of one card than another, you will see a positive number.  Less of one card will give you a negative number.  Missing cards will show and M by the name of the card and 'Sideboard' cards will have an S.</p>
